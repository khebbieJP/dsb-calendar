in this project we use beads for task management run `beads quickstart` to understand how it works.

We use mise en place to run tasks and for dependency management.

Always ensure tests are green and kept up to date.
We do not test details of the implementation but the outer interfaces.
If the application was once in a state and you change it, we do not need to know how it was before, or the changes you made - they are in git.
We only document the current state.

ensure you use python virtual environments to maintain a stable environment.
